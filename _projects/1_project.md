Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained images are the most common modality of pathological images, while accurate tumor subtyping is reliant on the information provided by various Immunohistochemistry (IHC) images. 

We initially attempted qualitative and quantitative analyses on the PD-L1. The focus on the project of lymphoma diagnosis with both H&E image and tens of IHC markers, simulating the entire workflow of pathological diagnosis.
