This data encompasses a variety of modalities including imaging, text, and structured data, and includes medical histories, imaging examinations, surgical records, pathology reports, laboratory test reports, discharge summaries, and follow-up records.

This project intends to explore the knowledge representation of diagnostic decision pathways that are jointly constructed with specialized disease decision maps and clinical case databases. Additionally, algorithms will be developed to integrate multi-modal information and temporal data, providing rich and expandable decision options.
