By combining the power of language and vision, large-scale vision-language models could unlocked exciting possibilities for the future applications. 

For instance, we could get more powerful image representations by leveraging the rich information in free-text reports. 

Furthermore, these models can be trained to generate descriptive captions for medical images, facilitating automated radiology reports generation.
