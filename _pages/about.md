Hi, I am an Associate Professor at [Qing Yuan Research Institute](https://www.qingyuan.sjtu.edu.cn), Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

Prior to SJTU, I spent two years in SenseBrain located in New Jersey, and one year in JD Group Silicon Valley Research Center.

I obtained my B.E. degree in Beihang University and Ph.D. degree of Computer Science from College of Computing and Informatics, [UNC Charlotte](https://www.charlotte.edu). 

My research topics include:  
  pathology image analysis, LLM in medical domain, and multi-modality decision making.

I am recruiting students. If you have a purposeless curiosity about this world, feel free to contact me.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.test

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
